# DiscoCast Visualizer 🎨

A modern browser-based MilkDrop music visualizer powered by [Butterchurn](https://github.com/jberg/butterchurn) (WebGL). Built with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS and bundled via Vite. Previously known as MilkScreen.

## Features

- **1,144 bundled MilkDrop presets** — official Butterchurn packs (Base, Extra, Extra2, MD1) + the community-curated Baron pack, all statically bundled (no network calls)
- **Advanced Audio Performance Suite** — real-time control over visual intensity via a glassmorphic popover
- **Auto-Gain Control (AGC)** — dynamic normalization ensuring consistent visual "hype" regardless of input volume (ON by default)
- **Kick-Lock Mode** — isolated frequency analysis (low-pass 150Hz) to lock visuals exclusively to the kick drum and bassline
- **Live Performance "Hype" Keys** — instant keyboard triggers for strobe, blackout, and color inversion
- **Dual audio input** — live audio capture or local audio file playback (MP3, WAV, FLAC)
- **Live device selection** — on every launch, a custom device picker modal enumerates all audio inputs and forces the user to choose (bypasses the browser's tendency to silently reuse the last-granted device); native support for USB DJ controllers, external sound cards, and specific microphones; single-device setups skip the picker automatically
- **Preset browser** — searchable drawer over the full 1,144-preset library with favorites/tabs, heart + hide icons per row, and instant left-anchored tooltips
- **Favorites-only cycling** — restrict auto-cycle to your hearted presets for curated sets
- **Hide unwanted presets** — eye-slash icon or `X` keyboard shortcut removes a preset from the All tab, random, and auto-cycle; hidden list persists in localStorage and survives reloads. A *Show hidden* toggle in the drawer exposes them for unhiding (individually or via a clean modal-confirmed "Unhide all"). Hide beats favorite in cycle — a hidden preset never auto-plays, but the Favorites tab still shows it so nothing is ever lost.
- **Auto-hiding controls** — glassmorphic control bar fades after 3 seconds of inactivity on the main visualizer, but stays visible while hovered or while a popover is open; click outside a popover to dismiss it
- **Material-style switches** — all toggles in the cycle and tuning popovers use clean sliding switch components
- **Fullscreen mode** — native browser fullscreen support
- **Projector Optimized** — automatic Screen Wake Lock prevents sleep (macOS app uses `caffeinate` fallback since WKWebView drops Wake Lock), mouse cursor auto-hides with UI, and "Zen Mode" (H key) for zero-UI projection
- **Output Settings** (`O` key or monitor icon) — lock canvas render resolution (HD / Full HD / QHD / 4K / Custom), constrain aspect ratio (16:9, 4:3, 21:9, 1:1, 9:16 portrait), choose fill mode (Letterbox / Stretch / Crop); settings persist across reloads. **Virtual Camera** toggle streams the canvas as a system webcam source — pick it in OBS, Zoom, or any capture app with no additional driver install
- **Responsive design** — works on desktop and mobile viewports
- **Preset Studio** (`/editor.html` or press **E**) — standalone visual preset builder: 12 one-click triad palettes (Wave / Glow / Accent in one click) **with hover-to-preview, per-channel 🔓/🔒 locks (Wave / Glow / Accent), and a "+ Save current mix" button that pins the active triplet as a 13th "My Mix" chip**, 3 independent color swatches (Wave / Glow / Accent), Palette tab with **Opacity** (0–1 — fades the MilkDrop background to black; image/video/GIF layers render on top at full brightness), **Glow Strength + Accent Strength** sliders that drive border alpha and size together as a single "loudness" axis, Brightness, Trail, Saturation (0–2), Hue Rotate (0–360°), Fade Wave in Silence, Outer/Inner Border sliders, and Brighten / Solarize / Darken / Darken Center / Invert toggles; 4 tabbed control sections (Palette / Motion / Wave / Images), undo/redo (50-deep), A/B comparison, **double-click any slider label to reset it to its default**; **Material-Symbols icon footer** — five equal-weight icon buttons with instant tooltips: **＋ New** (blank baseline), **🎲 Random** (one-click loads a random preset from the 1,144 bundled library as your editing base — turns the Studio into 1,144 starting points instead of one), **🎨 Remix** (re-rolls palette + motion + wave on whatever is currently loaded — formerly the ✨ Surprise button), **💾 Save**, **↺ Reset**; **Motion Presets** — six one-click motion looks at the top of the Motion tab (Vortex / Calm Drift / Earthquake / Tunnel In / Spin Lock / Hyperspace) with a ↺ Reset button that snaps every motion field back to defaults; **Wave engine fork** — variable **Thickness slider 0–8** (replaces the binary toggle; smoothly scales from hairline to bold) and **Rotation slider ±180°** (spins the wave shape around its own anchor; affects all 8 shape modes including Ripple) — both shipped via patches to the vendored Butterchurn engine in `src/vendor/butterchurn.js`; **Wave Reactivity** — audio-driven wave modulation parallel to Motion reactivity (Source + Curve + Size / Opacity / Shape / Orbit sliders, each with its own per-slider source pill so e.g. bass can drive wave size while treble morphs shape); **Wave Shape Reset** — ↺ on the Shape grid hides the wave entirely (`wave_a = 0`) so no shape button looks selected until you actively pick one; **up to 5 image layers** (images / GIFs / videos / text) in a collapsible smart-accordion stack with drag-to-reorder, per-layer solo / mute / rename / static thumbnail; **video layers** — drag MP4/WebM files (up to 720p), auto-transcode 1080p/4K videos to 720p on upload with progress toasts, full playback controls (play/pause, loop, speed 0.25×–4×, scrub), color grading (12 controls: Brightness, Contrast, Gamma, Fade, Color Temperature, Sepia, Blur, Shadows, Highlights, Lift, Gain, Tint M/G — all layer types), **independent Width and Height sliders** (non-uniform scaling 0.25×–4×, video-only), **Border** (width, color, feather — colored ring drawn outside video edge), all VJ effects work on video; **animated GIF layers** — perceptual speed control (0.25×–8× log curve), Alpha Mode (Fade / Preserve silhouette), timing Stability (0–1 variance smoothing); **GIF Optimizer** modal with Smooth Loop / Keep Detail / Lightweight intent presets and live cadence + variance preview; **text layers** — live text on presets with fonts, sizing, shadows, outlines, full transforms; **Shape Overlay** — per-layer full-screen colored shape (rectangle/circle/rounded) for masking, vignettes, or compositing; position, width/height, corner roundness, color, opacity, and feather controls; image resize on upload (1024px standard / 2048px HD toggle), per-layer UV mirror with Per Tile · Whole Image scope, scene-level Canvas Mirror, per-layer audio reactivity (source: Bass / Mid / Treble / Volume; curve: Linear / Squared / Cubed / Gate), aspect-correct tiling (portrait · square · landscape images tile without distortion), **Grid mode** — switch any tiled layer from density-driven tiling to an explicit Cols×Rows grid that fills the canvas, with *Fill* (stretch image to cell) or *Fit* (preserve aspect, transparent pad) and a *Scale* control (0.1–3×) to shrink the grid with a margin or zoom past the canvas edge; **recursive grids** — *Subdivide* (1–6) nests an inner sub-grid inside every grid cell and *Outer Gap* opens channels between the outer cells for a clustered grid-within-a-grid; **Per-Cell tile controls** — *Offset* (brick / half-drop stagger of alternating rows or columns), *Cell Rotate* (random per-tile rotation with optional 90° snap for a Truchet-style mosaic), *Popcorn* (per-cell audio pulse so individual tiles dance on different beat phases), *Size Var* / *Jitter X/Y* / *Opacity Var* (procedural per-cell variance — and with **scatter sampling**, jittered tiles break free of the grid: they drift past their cell boundaries and overlap each other), *Seed* + Lock (reshuffle or freeze the random pattern); **Pan** (whole-group L/R + U/D translation — Drift for continuous travel/endless tile scroll, Bounce for independent-axis ping-pong), **Chromatic Aberration** (per-layer RGB split with animated offset), **per-layer Saturation** (0–2 greyscale→vivid) and **per-layer Hue Rotate** (0–360° — shifts image hue independently of the palette), **VJ Effects suite** — Luma Key (cut by brightness), Wave Distort (audio-reactive sinusoidal UV warp), Invert (color negative blend), Solarize (tone-curve fold — midtones blow bright, darks/highlights crush), Threshold (binary B&W with audio-reactive cutoff), Pixelate (retro mosaic blocks), Scan Lines (CRT bands), Film Grain (animated noise overlay); dev performance HUD (`` ` `` key); saves to localStorage
- **Timeline Editor** (`/timeline.html` or press **L**) — self-contained full-screen show sequencer: canvas fills the screen, glassmorphic controls are always visible; a **fullscreen button** (top-right, or press `F`) hides all controls and enters true fullscreen — outside the browser on web, window-fullscreen in the macOS app; pressing `F`, clicking the button again, or pressing `Escape` restores controls; arrange presets on a proportional-width multi-track strip, set block lengths by dragging their edges — the strip auto-scrolls as you drag, so a block stretches to any length in one continuous motion; **standard 3-button transport** — go-to-start (`⏮`), play/stop, skip-to-next-block (`⏵`) with `Home` and `→` keyboard shortcuts; **real-time live editing** — drag blocks, resize, edit settings, duplicate, or delete while the timeline is playing; changes take effect immediately with no flash or stutter (`_rescheduleIfPlaying()` cancels stale timers and rebuilds from the current playhead); **double-click to cue** — double-click any block body to crossfade from the currently-playing preset into that block and seek the playhead to its start time; **block menu** — a hamburger icon on each block opens a compact action menu: a **Transition picker** (Fade / Black / White / Cut — how the block enters), a **colour picker** (16-colour palette swatch in the header), plus Duplicate and Delete; single-click the block body = select and drag, double-click = cue; **per-block transitions** — choose how each block enters: Fade (crossfade from the previous preset), dip through Black or White, or a hard Cut; **Zone Compositor** assigns each entry to a named screen region (quadrant, banner, center square, custom rectangle) so multiple presets render simultaneously in different areas — each zone has independent opacity, blend mode (screen/overlay/multiply/add), and gap behavior; supports drag-to-reorder, snap-to-grid, waveform overlay, BPM grid; **markers & loop regions** — markers live in a dedicated lane below the ruler; press `M` or click the lane to drop one, click a flag to edit it (label, colour, action). Set a marker's action to **Loop** and it becomes a draggable **loop region** — a band with handles you drag to size it; playback wraps the region with a 1-second crossfade. The ruler is playhead-only (click to seek); **Export** saves a `.dcshow.json` bundle that embeds all referenced custom presets including image layers as base64 — fully portable across devices; **Import** restores the timeline and all custom presets, remapping IDs automatically, and shows a detailed result modal listing every imported preset and any failures

```

- **Mic mode**: Audio goes only to the visualizer (no speaker output to avoid feedback)
- **File mode**: Audio is split — one path to speakers (with volume control), one path to the visualizer (with 5× sensitivity gain)

### Key Classes

#### `VisualizerEngine` (`src/visualizer.js`)

Core engine wrapping Butterchurn. Manages audio context, source connections, preset loading, render loop, and auto-cycling.

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `init(canvas)` | Initialize WebGL visualizer on a canvas element |
| `connectMicrophone(deviceId)` | Connect browser mic or specific USB/audio device as source |
| `connectAudioFile(file)` | Connect a File object as audio source |
| `disconnectSource()` | Stop and clean up current audio source |
| `loadPreset(name, blendTime)` | Load a preset by name with blend transition |
| `nextPreset()` / `prevPreset()` | Navigate presets sequentially (always over the full library) |
| `randomPreset()` | Jump to a random preset (always over the full library) |
| `cycleNext()` / `cycleRandom()` | Advance within the current cycle pool — respects favorites-only |
| `setFavoritePool(names)` | Provide the list of favorite preset names used by favorites-only cycling |
| `setFavoritesOnly(enabled)` | Restrict auto-cycle to favorites when true (falls back to full library if empty) |
| `getPresetNames()` | Returns sorted array of all preset names |
| `getCurrentPresetName()` | Returns the active preset name |
| `setSize(w, h)` | Resize the visualizer canvas |
| `setVolume(value)` | Set speaker volume (0–1) |
| `setEnergy(value)` | Set manual energy multiplier (0.2–5.0) |
| `toggleAGC()` | Toggle dynamic Auto-Gain Control |
| `toggleKickLock()` | Toggle bass-frequency isolation filter |
| `setBoost(active)` | Momentary 2× intensity override (bound to `Shift`) |
| `destroy()` | Full cleanup — stops render, audio, timers |
| `startTimeline(id, startIndex?)` | Play a saved timeline; optionally start from a given entry index |
| `stopTimeline()` | Stop active timeline and resume auto-cycle |
| `timelineNext()` | Skip to next entry in the active timeline |
| `timelinePrev()` | Go back to previous entry in the active timeline |
| `getTimelineState()` | Returns active timeline playback state, or `null` if no timeline is playing |

#### `ControlPanel` (`src/controls.js`)

UI controller binding all DOM events, keyboard shortcuts, auto-hide behavior, preset drawer, and audio player controls.

#### `EditorInspector` (`src/editor/inspector.js`)

Full panel controller for Preset Studio. Manages 4 tabbed sections (Palette / Motion / Wave / Images), palette chips, color swatches, undo/redo stack, A/B comparison, and save-to-localStorage.

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `undo()` / `redo()` | Step through 50-deep history stack (called from keyboard handler in `editor/main.js`) |

Palette system maps 12 named moods (Mono, Neon, Electric, Fire, Violet, Ocean, Sunset, Ice, Gold, Rose, Acid, Plasma) to Wave + Glow + Accent `baseVals` triads. Three swatches (Wave → `wave_r/g/b`, Glow → `ob_r/g/b`, Accent → `ib_r/g/b`) are independently overridable after applying a palette. Saturation (`studio_saturation`) and Hue Rotate (`studio_hue_rotate`) are baked as GLSL literals into the comp shader post-FX block at compile time — zero cost at default values.

#### `customPresets.js` (`src/customPresets.js`)

Single source of truth for custom preset CRUD.

| Export | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `createCustomPreset(name, state)` | Save a new custom preset to localStorage |
| `saveCustomPreset(id, state)` | Update an existing preset |
| `getCustomPreset(id)` | Load one preset by id |
| `deleteCustomPreset(id)` | Remove from storage |
| `loadAllCustomPresets()` | Return all saved custom presets |
| `storeImage(blob)` | Persist image blob to IndexedDB, return imageId |
| `getImage(imageId)` | Retrieve image blob by id |
| `exportPreset(id)` | Serialize preset + inlined images as base64 data-URLs to JSON |
| `exportAllPresets()` | Bulk export all custom presets as a single JSON bundle |
| `importPreset(json)` | Validate, re-hydrate images to IndexedDB, write metadata to localStorage |
| `importFromFile(json)` | Batch import (single preset, array, or bulk bundle); returns `{ imported, names, failed }` |

Storage schema: `{ id, name, schemaVersion: 1, baseVals, shapes, waves, warp, comp, init_eqs, frame_eqs, pixel_eqs, images, parentPresetName?, createdAt, updatedAt }`. Registry key format: `custom:<id>:<name>` prevents collision with bundled names.

#### `presetRegistry.js` (`src/presetRegistry.js`)

Merge layer exposing bundled + custom presets under one API.

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `getAllNames()` | All preset names — bundled + custom |
| `getByName(name)` | Resolve preset object (custom or bundled) by name |
| `getBundledNames()` | Bundled-only names |
| `getCustomPresets()` | Custom-only preset map |
| `isCustom(name)` | Whether a name is a custom preset |
| `displayName(name)` | Strip `custom:<id>:` prefix for display |
| `refresh()` | Re-read localStorage after an external write |

### Keyboard Shortcuts

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start dev server (safe — kills zombie processes + clears stale cache first)
npm run dev:safe
# → http://localhost:5173/

# Start dev server (fast — only use when you know Vite was cleanly stopped last time)
npm run dev

# Production build
npm run build
# → Output in dist/
```

> **Always use `npm run dev:safe` to start a session.** It kills any lingering Vite processes
> and wipes the dep-optimization cache before starting. If you only use `npm run dev` and a
> previous session wasn't closed cleanly (terminal window closed instead of Ctrl+C), the next
> start will appear to hang or fail with a port conflict. `npm run dev:safe` always recovers.
>
> **Stop Vite cleanly:** always use **Ctrl+C** in the terminal before closing the window.

## macOS App

A standalone, signed, and notarized macOS app — fully working including mic and USB audio input.

### Install
1. Download `DiscoCast-Visualizer.dmg` from the [promo page](promo/index.html)
2. Drag **DiscoCast Visualizer** → **Applications**
3. Launch from Applications — no right-click needed (notarized)
4. First time using mic/USB: macOS will prompt for microphone permission — click **Allow**

### Build from Source

> ⚠️ **Always use `./build-and-sign.sh` — never run `npm run tauri-build` directly.**
> The script is the true build process. Running Tauri directly produces an unsigned, unnotarized DMG with no Applications folder shortcut that will be blocked by Gatekeeper.
>
> **Claude Code guardrail:** Run `./build-and-sign.sh` with no flags and NOT in background mode. Output must stream live. Never add `2>&1`. Never use `run_in_background`. If it appears to hang during notarization — it isn't; just wait.

```bash
./build-and-sign.sh
```

The script does everything in one pass:
1. Builds the Vite web app
2. Builds unsigned `.app` with Tauri (target: `app` only)
3. Injects `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` into `Info.plist`
4. Signs with `Developer ID Application: Paul Henshaw (3UT7698LZ6)` + hardened runtime
5. Notarizes with Apple (`xcrun notarytool`) and staples the ticket
6. Verifies: `source=Notarized Developer ID`
7. Creates HFS+ drag-to-install DMG with Applications folder shortcut
8. Signs and clears quarantine from the DMG
9. Copies versioned DMG to `promo/DiscoCast Visualizer-1.0.YYYYMMDD.HHMM.dmg`
10. Updates `promo/DiscoCast-Visualizer.dmg` (the canonical download link)

Requires: Apple Developer account (`3UT7698LZ6`), credentials in `.build-credentials` (gitignored), Rust/Cargo, Xcode tools.

### Releasing a Build

After `./build-and-sign.sh` completes, commit and push `promo/` to deploy:

```bash
git add promo/
git commit -m "build: release 1.0.YYYYMMDD.HHMM"
git push
```

Coolify picks up the push automatically — the promo page immediately serves the new DMG. Older versioned builds are retained in `promo/` for rollback: copy any older DMG over `promo/DiscoCast-Visualizer.dmg`, commit, and push.

See `macos-app-generate.md` for full packaging details and `app-output-dev.md` § 7 for the complete distribution workflow.

## Windows App

A standalone Windows app built via GitHub Actions on demand — produces a single NSIS `.exe` installer.

### Install
1. Download `DiscoCast-Visualizer-Windows-Setup.exe` from the [promo page](promo/index.html)
2. Double-click the `.exe` to install
3. Launch **DiscoCast Visualizer** from the Start menu
4. First time using mic/USB: Windows will prompt for microphone permission — click **Allow**

> Windows may show a SmartScreen warning ("Unknown publisher") on first launch. Click **More info → Run anyway**. This is expected for unsigned builds — the app is safe.

### Build from GitHub Actions

The Windows build runs on a GitHub-hosted Windows machine triggered manually — no Windows PC required.

1. Go to your repo on **GitHub.com → Actions → Build Windows Installer**
2. Click **Run workflow** → select branch `main` → **Run workflow**
3. Wait ~10–15 min (first run); ~5 min after Rust cache warms up
4. When complete, click the run → scroll to **Artifacts** → download `DiscoCast-Visualizer-Windows-Setup`
5. Unzip → run the `.exe`

Nothing runs automatically — the build only starts when you click the button.

> The workflow file lives at `.github/workflows/build-windows.yml`. It is manual-trigger only (`workflow_dispatch`) and touches no existing macOS or web build infrastructure. See [`windows-dev.md`](windows-dev.md) for full build details and bugs fixed during Windows bringup.

## Deployment (Coolify)

This app is optimized for ultra-lightweight deployment via **Coolify**. Two methods are supported:

### 1. Dockerfile + Nginx (Recommended)
The repository includes a multi-stage `Dockerfile` that builds the Vite app and serves it using `nginx:alpine` (along with a custom `nginx.conf`).
- **Resource Footprint:** Extremely small (< 5MB RAM idle, ~0% CPU).
- **Setup in Coolify:** Select **Docker** as your Build Pack. Coolify will automatically detect the Dockerfile.

### 2. Nixpacks + sirv-cli
If you prefer a Node.js-based static server, the project includes `sirv-cli` as a dependency and a configured `start` script.
- **Setup in Coolify:** Leave Build Pack as **Nixpacks**. Coolify will run `npm install`, `npm run build`, and `npm run start`.

### Password Gate

The app is protected by a single-password overlay shown on first visit. After the user enters the correct password, a `localStorage` marker unlocks them automatically on future visits.

**Configure in Coolify:**
1. Go to your app → **Environment Variables**.
2. Add `VITE_APP_PASSWORD` with your chosen password.
3. **Check the "Build Variable" / "Is Build Time" box** — Vite inlines the value at build time, so it must be available when `npm run build` runs, not just at runtime.
4. Redeploy.

**Local dev:** copy `.env.example` → `.env` and set `VITE_APP_PASSWORD=something`. Leaving it blank disables the gate.

**Security note:** Because this is a static SPA, the password is present in the built JS bundle and visible to anyone who inspects DevTools. Treat it as a soft gate to keep casual visitors out, not as real auth — there is no private content behind it to protect. For stronger protection, switch to nginx HTTP Basic Auth in [nginx.conf](nginx.conf) or put a real auth service (Authelia, Cloudflare Access) in front.

### Security Posture

The app ships with a hardened HTTP response baseline (see [nginx.conf](nginx.conf)):

| Header | Value | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `Content-Security-Policy` | `default-src 'self'` + allowlist for Google Fonts, `data:`/`blob:` for images/media | Blocks unexpected script execution and cross-origin loads |
| `X-Frame-Options` | `DENY` | Prevents clickjacking (the page can't be iframed) |
| `X-Content-Type-Options` | `nosniff` | Blocks MIME-sniffing on JS/CSS |
| `Referrer-Policy` | `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` | Don't leak full URLs to outbound links |
| `Permissions-Policy` | `microphone=(self), camera=(), geolocation=()` | Scopes microphone to first-party only; blocks the rest |

**CSP allowlist** (if you add new origins, update `nginx.conf`):
- `script-src 'self'` — all JS is bundled; no inline scripts, no CDNs
- `style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' fonts.googleapis.com` — inline `style=""` attrs + Google Fonts CSS
- `font-src 'self' fonts.gstatic.com` — Google Fonts woff2
- `img-src 'self' data: blob:` — custom preset images (data URLs) and blob URLs
- `media-src 'self' blob:` — user-loaded audio files via `URL.createObjectURL`
- `frame-ancestors 'none'` — not embeddable

After changing `nginx.conf`, redeploy and check the browser Console for CSP violation messages. A single violation breaks whatever it touches silently.

**Out of scope / known soft spots:**
- **Password-in-bundle** — covered above. Not real auth by design.
- **HTTPS / HSTS** — terminated at the Coolify reverse proxy, not in this Dockerfile. Verify HTTPS redirect is enabled on the Coolify app.
- **Image layer injection (editor)** — `file.name` from user uploads is set via `textContent`/`title` (not `innerHTML`) so it can't XSS. Preset names in the import result modal are HTML-escaped by `importResultModal.js`.

## Dependencies

| Package | Version | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `butterchurn` | ^2.6.7 | MilkDrop WebGL visualizer engine |
| `butterchurn-presets` | ^2.4.7 | 395 unique presets across Base/Extra/Extra2/MD1 sub-packs (bundled) |
| `butterchurn-presets-baron` | ^1.5.1 | 762 community-curated presets (bundled via `import.meta.glob`) |
| `@ffmpeg/ffmpeg` | ^0.12.10 | Video transcoding — auto-downscale 1080p/4K to 720p on upload (lazy-loaded ~25MB) |
| `@ffmpeg/util` | ^0.12.1 | FFmpeg helper utilities for file I/O |
| `gifuct-js` | ^2.1.2 | GIF frame parsing for animated GIF layers |
| `vite` | ^8.0.4 | Dev server and build tool |

> **Notes**:
> - `butterchurn-presets-weekly` is installed but **unused** — it only contains remote S3 URLs, not preset data.
> - The Baron pack ships each preset as a separate JSON file loaded via top-level `await import()`. We bypass that runtime loop with Vite's `import.meta.glob({ eager: true })` and collapse all 762 files into a single build-time chunk (see [vite.config.js](vite.config.js) `manualChunks` rule). Without this, startup would issue 762 sequential network requests.
> - Final merge yields **1,144 unique presets** (13 name overlaps between the official packs and Baron; later packs override).
> - FFmpeg.wasm is **lazy-loaded** — the ~25MB binary only downloads when a user uploads an oversized video (1080p/4K). Standard 720p uploads don't trigger the download.

## Integration Notes (DiscoCast Silent Disco)

The `VisualizerEngine` is designed for easy integration:

```js
import { VisualizerEngine } from './src/visualizer.js';

const engine = new VisualizerEngine();
engine.init(canvasElement);

// Connect any Web Audio API source node directly:
// yourSourceNode.connect(engine.visualizerGainNode);

// Or use the built-in helpers:
await engine.connectMicrophone();
// or
const audioEl = await engine.connectAudioFile(fileObject);
```

**Key integration points:**
- The `visualizerGainNode` is a standard Web Audio `GainNode` — any audio source can be connected to it
- The engine does not manage its own `<canvas>` element — pass any canvas from your app
- `setSize(w, h)` can be called on window resize or container resize
- `destroy()` performs full cleanup of audio context, render loop, and timers
- The `ControlPanel` is optional — you can use `VisualizerEngine` standalone and build your own UI

## Browser Requirements

- **WebGL 2** — required for Butterchurn rendering
- **Web Audio API** — required for audio analysis
- **getUserMedia** — required for microphone input
- Best experience in **Chrome** or **Firefox**

## Developer Workflow

### Editing Help / User Guide Content

There are **two help systems** — edit the right one:

| Button / entry point | File to edit | Location in file |
|---|---|---|
| "User Guide" on main app start screen | `index.html` | `id="help-modal"` ~line 1315 |
| Standalone `/help.html` page | `help.html` | Full page, nav-linked sections |

**There is no help modal in `editor.html`.** The Preset Studio has no in-app user guide.

### Dev Server Troubleshooting

If `npm run dev` fails, hangs, or gives a port conflict:

```bash
npm run dev:safe
```

This kills any zombie Vite processes, wipes the `.vite` dep cache, and starts fresh. Use it as
your default start command. `node_modules/.vite-temp/` left over from a crashed prior session
is the most common cause of startup failures — `dev:safe` removes it automatically.
